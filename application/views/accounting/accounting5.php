                                This is the traditional system of accounting. Manual accounting uses several paper ledgers and journals where accountants record financial information. The general ledger includes miscellaneous transactions and the aggregate balance of all subsidiary ledgers and journals. Manual accounting is very risky and required more care to enter information into physical books. Traditional manual accounting was a tedious process requiring accountants to spend copious amounts of time mathematically checking numbers in the company accounting information. Simple mistakes such as transposing numbers or entering information into the incorrect column could create significant errors.

                                Computerized accounting uses software programs designed from traditional manual accounting systems. Computerized accounting involves the use of computers, spreadsheets and programs designed to record and report financial information electronically.

                                        Computerized accounting often requires individuals to manually input financial information into the program. The accounting program is responsible for making sure journal entries balance prior to posting information into the company general ledger. Financial reports are usually generated according to a business owner preset parameters. Financial reports and statements often contain a default feature to ensure all information is accurate and valid prior to creating financial reports. Computerized accounting systems allow accountants to process more information than before by creating easier review processes. Accountants can potentially spend less time looking for errors and more time analyzing information for decision purposes.
