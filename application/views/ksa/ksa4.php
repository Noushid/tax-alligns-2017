                                    The government of Saudi Arabia is collecting income tax and Zakat from the businesses. But there are few conditions to be charged under income tax and Zakat. Only non-Saudi investors are liable for income tax in KSA. The citizens of the GCC countries are normally considered to be Saudi citizens for income tax purposes in Saudi Arabia.

                                    In most cases, Saudi citizen investors are liable for Zakat, an Islamic assessment. Normally Zakat is payable is on the Zakath Base. Zakat base represents the net worth of the entity as calculated for Zakat purposes. Where a company is owned by both Saudi and non-Saudi interests, the portion of taxable income attributable to the non-Saudi interest is subject to income tax, and the Saudi share goes into the basis on which Zakat is assessed. Zakat is charged on the company’s Zakat base at 2.5%.
