Now the Govt. of India made new form of business for the well being of farm producers that is termed as Producer Company. Producer Company is a form of business formation under which the farmers/producers can do business in a safe zone.

                                        A producer company is thus a hybrid between a private limited company and a cooperative society. It combines the goodness of a cooperative enterprise and the vibrancy and efficiency of a company. It accommodates the unique elements of cooperative business with a regulatory framework similar to that of a private limited company.
