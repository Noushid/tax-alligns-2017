                                    A hierarchical organization is an organizational structure where every entity in the organization, except one, is subordinates to a single other entity. This arrangement is a form of a hierarchy. Hierarchy in a business refers to the levels of management in any business, from highest to lowest. Those on a higher level have more decision-making power and control than employees who occupy a lower level in the hierarchy. Lower level workers take direction from higher level employees Hierarchy is important in an organization due to the hierarchy of authority provides a clear career path for each employee in the organization. Executives and managers can use the hierarchy as motivation for employees that show supervisory or managerial potential to perform at a high level of productivity. This means having to balance many tasks efficiently and effectively. If a business' systems are not properly organized, tasks pile up, paperwork gets lost and valuable time is spent on finding information that should be readily available. Good organizational skills can save a business owner time and reduce stress.

                                        The hierarchy has permeated virtually every company around the world regardless of size, industry, or location. The greatest strength of the hierarchy used to be that it was so reliable at maintain the status quo, which was exactly what companies wanted decades ago. However what was once its strength is now its greatest weakness. The hierarchy is a very resilient management structure that has been so embedded in how we work that most organizations around the world are having a tedious time getting rid of it. A hierarchical organization follows the layout of a pyramid. Every employee in the organization, except one, usually the CEO, is subordinate to someone else within the organization. The layout consists of multiple entities that descend into the base of staff level employees, who sit at the bottom of the pyramid.
