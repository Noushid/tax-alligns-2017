                                    It is the greatest opinion that employees, including volunteers, are the most important resource for any company. How employees are treated and how much they value the company they work for will have an impact on how the company performs. Diversity, health and safety, workplace conditions, personal development, work/life balance and remuneration are all issues that responsible employers need to address to ensure a happy, motivated workforce. There may be normal employees and key employees in your company’s staff pattern.

                                        Key employee retention is critical to the long-term health and success of your business. Managers readily agree that retaining your best employees ensures customer satisfaction, product sales, satisfied coworkers and reporting staff, effective succession planning and deeply embedded organizational knowledge and learning
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pb20">
                                        As a manager you need to encourage an ongoing, two way dialog that’s based on trust – about assignments and about deliverables, of course – but beyond that, about an employee’s career goals and aspirations.  If, as a manager, you don’t know how an employee would like to grow professionally, you can’t tailor opportunities to meet their needs, and you risk losing them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="pb20">
                                        So how do you build “trust”?  Especially if employees are remotely located, possibly from different cultures, and the primary relationship is “virtual” at best….
                                    </p>

                                        The funny thing about communication is that it’s as much about the words you say, as it is about the tone of your voice combined with eye contact, hand gestures, body positioning, and even touch. Studies found that a large percentage of the meaning we derive from communication (some studies suggest over 90%) is derived from the non-verbal cues the other person gives.  So, if you only meet “virtually” with your team, much of your message and their response to it may be lost. Face time, however scarce, is an immensely important factor in communicating well and establishing trust. If you are managing employees in remote locations, try to meet with them in person on a regular basis – maybe not monthly -- but at least 2 to 3 times per year.

Be accessible for, and open to, problem solving – whether it’s brainstorming next steps or fighting fires.  And, be accessible personally – taking a genuine interest in employees as individuals, as people.

                                        When hiring, look inside first.  Make it a priority to scan the internal environment first to see if there are existing employees who could stretch into the new position…growing to the next level.  Make sure employees are aware of internal openings and have a chance to apply for them if they’re interested.

Or, awarding a personal day after completion of a ‘hairy-scary’ assignment?  </p>

                                        Involve employees in the change process. Employees are not so much against change as they are against being changed. Any time managers are going to implement organizational change; there is always a lag between the time the change has been discussed at the management level and the time the change is going to be implemented. Managers like to play like an ostrich and believe that they are the only ones who know about the changes that are going to take place. Unfortunately, while their heads are stuck in the sand believing that no one else knows, employees are effectively undermining the future changes with negative informal communication…the company grapevine. The sooner you involve employees in the process; the better off you will be implementing the change. A formal communication channel is more effective at implementing change than a negative informal one.

                                    </div> 
                                    <p class="pb20">It is critical that managers and supervisors understand what employees are feeling regarding the change. It is only when you accurately understand their feelings that you know what issues need to be addressed. Implementing change requires the ability to market and to sell. It is difficult to effectively sell without understanding your buyer’s needs, concerns, and fears.</p>
                                    <div class="title-post">
                                        <h4 class="headg">Concentrate on effective delegation.</h4>
                                    </div> 
                                    <p class="pb20">Too often managers and supervisors feel they must use self-protective measures, especially during organizational change. They start by trying to police all activities. Don’t try to cover all the bases yourself. You should concentrate on effective delegation during the early stages of the change process. Effective delegation is particularly good for two reasons: first, it helps you manage and maintain your workload, and second, it gives your employees a sense of involvement. Involvement positions employees to share responsibility for change.</p>

                                        <h4 class="headg">Raise levels of expectations.</h4>

                                    <p class="pb20">Now more than ever, you should ask more from your employees. It is expected that more work needs to be done during the change process. While it may be most practical to expect less in terms of performance, raise your levels of expectations and theirs. During change, employees are more likely to alter their work habits, so reach for the opportunity and push them to try harder and work smarter. Require performance improvements and make the process challenging, but remember to keep goals realistic in order to eliminate frustration and failure.</p>

                                    <p class="pb20">Once the change has been announced, it is important that you personally ask for each employee’s commitment to successfully implement the change. It is also important that you assure the employee that if there are problems, you want to hear about them. If a negative employee does not tell you, they will tell other employees why the change will not work.</p>
                                    <div class="title-post">
                                        <h4 class="headg">Expand communication channels.</h4>
                                    </div> 
                                    <p class="pb20">The change process usually means that normal communication channels in the firm need to be enlarged. At this time, your employees will be hungrier than ever for information and answers. You can “beef up” communication. First, give employees an opportunity to give you input. Start by becoming more available and asking more questions. Get employees’ opinions and reactions to the changes. Maintain your visibility and make it clear that you are an accessible boss. More importantly, be a careful listener. Second, keep employees updated on a regular basis. Just letting your employees know that you have no new information is meaningful information to them. Strive to be specific; clear up rumors and misinformation that clutter the communication channels. Remember, it is almost impossible to over communicate.</p>

                                        <h4 class="headg">Be firm, committed, and flexible.</h4>

                                    <p class="pb20">
                                        As you introduce a change, it is important that you see the change through to completion. Abandoning it halfway through the change process accomplishes two negative impacts. First, it destroys your credibility. Second, it tells every employee that if you take the stance of a dinosaur, the change will pass by, even if you lose your job and become extinct in the process. Remain flexible, because you will have to adapt to situations to successfully implement the changes.

                                    <p class="pb20">
                                        Your attitude as a manager or supervisor will be a major factor in determining what type of climate is exhibited by your employees. Your attitude is the one thing that keeps you in control. Change can be stressful and confusing. Try to remain upbeat, positive, and enthusiastic. Foster motivation in others. During times of transition and change, try to compensate your employees for their extra effort. Write a brief note of encouragement on their paychecks; leave an affirming message on their voice mail; take them aside and tell them what a great job they are doing; listen to their comments and suggestions. Last, try to instill organizational change as a personal challenge that everyone can meet…with success
