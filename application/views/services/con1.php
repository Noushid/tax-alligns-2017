                                    <b>Do you have a passion for changing business? </b><br />
                                    <b>Do you have what it takes to inspire staff to greatness? </b><br />

                                    You must need a direction from outside but by standing with you, knowing you, knowing the world of business strategy. That is motivation speech. A motivational speaker is simply someone who renders speeches in order to motivate or inspire you. But from corporate experience, we know that the work of a motivational speaker goes beyond just motivating and inspiring. And for that we have to study you and be ready for you.

                                    Modern day motivational speakers now engage in career talks and development, character and team building, entrepreneurial skill development, life coaching, ethics and corporate culture appreciation, staff orientation and training, mentorship, etc.

                                        Employees are playing vital role in the success of any brand or idea. Employees are behind the flag of a leader. Look to the fact that time goes same for all in the world. But the employees’ engagement varies from organization to organization. Few of smart leaders take advantage of the fact that some things never change. For example, take employee engagement. A report in U.S says that only 30 percent of the U.S workforce is engaged in their work. In other words, they love their jobs. Seventy percent are “not engaged” or “actively disengaged,” meaning they hate their jobs or, at best, are unenthusiastic about their roles. This is not only in U.S, but also the world as a whole. What to do to companies. Noting but encourage the men at company.

                                        Most of these disengaged employees are looking for inspiration. They are searching for meaning and they want to have someone or something to believe in. They want to make a difference and they’re looking to you, the management, for inspiration.

                                    <p class="pb20">Most employees—especially the millennial generation—want more than a paycheck. They want to feel as though their work has meaning. They need to see how their jobs or projects connect to the big picture.</p>

                                    <p class="pb20">Few people care about the “how” until they know “why” they are doing what they are being asked to do. There are many entrepreneurs who had good ideas but failed to inspire investors because they could not clearly communicate the benefit behind their product or idea. Employees, too, want to understand the benefit. People are inspired when they know exactly how your initiative, product, or idea will improve their lives. </p>

                                    <p class="pb20">Many of the top brands are to ask for honest feedback from employees, professionals, executives, customers, and former customers. They listening and giving people what they asked for. All these companies are communicating between leadership and staff. Everything is shared—the good and bad news. Employees are involved in every major decision. Most important, senior leaders make it a point to solicit feedback regularly.</p>

                                    <p class="pb20">Successful leaders are more optimistic than average. They act bravely and speak with courage and confidence about the future. They see the world differently. Where many see gloom, despair, tumult and turbulence, inspiring leaders see a bright, positive world full of hope and joy. According to Noyce, “optimism is an essential ingredient of innovation. How else can the individual welcome change over security, adventure over staying in safe places?”</p>

                                    <p class="pb20"> “When you lavish praise on people, they flourish; criticize and they shrivel up.” We should give compliments constantly—to the staff, crew, and company personnel. Just walks the talk.</p>
                                    <p class="pb20">You might be a leader who shares each of these qualities. It doesn’t mean that every one of your employees will love you and their jobs. A high percentage of the 70 percent of employees who are “disengaged” might simply be in the wrong job and no amount of motivation will help. But read the last quality carefully—inspiring leaders encourage people to be their best selves. These leaders take a genuine interest in people as individuals. They talk to their employees about their hopes, dreams, and interests. They encourage employees to change jobs if they must or seek out positions within or outside the company that best suits their passion and skills.</p>
