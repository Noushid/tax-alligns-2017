                                    As mentioned above, an Indian subsidiary company means a company which is incorporated in India. The incorporation in India is subject to current ceiling/limit of foreign direct investment. Though a foreign corporation can start a business in India in various formats like, a project office, a representative office or by opening a branch office, in all such type the Indian entity so created remains a foreign entity which is subject to higher rates of taxes and stringent regulations. In case the foreign corporation has plans to operate in India on full-fledged scale just like an Indian company then a subsidiary company of such a foreign company is the answer. As an Indian Subsidiary Company, it shall be subject to the same set of rules which applies to any other Indian company.

Foreign Direct Investment of upto 100% is allowed under the automatic route in most activities/sectors in India.

                                        A producer company should be named using the following suffixÂ ââ¦..Producer Company Limitedâ appropriately indicating its status as a producer company. The word âprivateâ is not used in the naming process and the absence of which does not indicate that the company is a âPublicâ. Ensure that name is not similar to any other Producer company. Also, do check if the name is not a registered trademark taken by anybody under the IP Act. Also, ensure that the name is not too generic to be accepted by the ROC. Avoid using abbreviations, adjectives.
