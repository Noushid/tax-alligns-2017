                                    A trademark is a visual symbol in the form of a word, a device, or a label applied to articles of commerce. A Trademark generally refers to a “brand” or “logo”. Trademark is essentially another word for brand or brand name. A trademark can be any name, word, symbol, slogan, or device that serves to both identify and distinguish a business or product from others in the market.  Trademark registration can also be obtained for a business name, distinctive catch phrases, taglines or captions. Properly used and promoted, a Trademark may become the most valuable asset of a business. Trademarks such as Coca Cola, HP, Canon, Nike and Adidas serve as an indication of origin of the goods as well as an indication of quality. A trademark is often referred to as a brand or a brand name and is used by businesses as an identification sign to distinguish their goods or services from those of their competitors.

                                <p class="pb20">
                                    It is also essential to obtain trademark registration for the business name/trade name under the Trademarks Act. Registration of a company or business name under the Companies Act does not in itself give protection against others who might commence using identical or similar marks.
