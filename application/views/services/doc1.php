                                    The document in which the respective rights and obligations of the members of a partnership is written is called the Partnership Deed. A partnership deed agreement may be written or oral. However, practically oral agreement does not have any value for tax purposes and therefore. A partnership deed is a written legal document to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding, harassment and unpleasantness among the partners in the event of any dispute. For mutual benefit, the registration of Deed of Partnership is made under the Indian Registration Act, 1908 so as to avoid apprehension of the Deed of partnership being destroyed or mutilated in the possession of the partners. A deed of partnership is required to be made out and registered under the Indian movable property Act together with other movable properties involved. An instrument of partnership may be constituted by more than one document.

                                        This Partnership Agreement can be used by Partners wishing to form a partnership for doing business together. It is strongly recommended or encouraged for partnerships to have some kind of agreement among themselves, in case future disputes prove difficult to arbitrate. It is meant to promote mutual understanding and avoid mistrust. It indicates the terms on which the business corporation is founded. The partnership agreement must be printed on a Non-Judicial Stamp Paper with a value of Rs.100/- or more. For GST and Income Tax purpose, it would be required in a paper with value of Rs.5000. The partnership agreement is usually signed in the presence of all the partners and each of the partners would retain a signed original for his/her records.
