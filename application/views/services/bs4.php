                                    With the introduction of the Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) in India through the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008, the prominence of Partnership’s has been replaced by the LLPs. LLPs are easy to register, offer a range of benefits to the promoters and is easy to maintain, making it ideal for many small and medium sized business that would otherwise opt to start as a Proprietorship or a Private Limited Company. The Minimum Capital contribution are 1,00,000 for a Private Company – 5,00,000 for a Public Company. No such mandatory requirement and moreover, the contribution of a partner may consist of tangible, movable or immovable or intangible property or other benefit to the LLP.

                                    LLPs are registered under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. The Partners of a LLP are not personally liable for the liabilities of the Partnership and the liability of a Partner is limited to the amount of his/her capital contribution to the LLP. Therefore, the LLP and the Partners of a LLP are considered to be separate legal entities and the LLP has a perpetual existence, until dissolved by the Promoters.

Minors are however not allowed to be part of a LLP. A LLP must have a minimum of 2 Partners and is allowed to have unlimited Partners. The LLP Agreement governs aspects of management of a LLP and one or more Partners can be designated to manage the activities of the LLP.

                                    There are a number of reasons why many entrepreneurs prefer to go in for a Limited Liability Partnership over a Private Limited Company. It is considered easier to set up, as a rule is comparatively hassle-free in day to day operations, has significantly lower burdensome compliance requirements and costs, and therefore many see it as advantageous to begin their organization in this manner. Let us look at some of the reasons for this choice and the LLP Advantages.
                                </p>

                                <p class="pb20">
                                    As against company there is no minimum capital requirement in LLP. An LLP can be formed with least possible capital. The particulars of Minimum Capital contribution are 1. Private Company – 1,00,000; 2. Public Company – 5, 00,000; no such mandatory requirement and moreover, the contribution of a partner may consist of tangible, movable or immovable or intangible property or other benefit to the LLP.

                                    An LLP requires a minimum 2 partners while there is no limit on the maximum number of partners; this is in contrast to a private limited company wherein there is a restriction of not having more than 200 members.
                                </p>

A Limited Liability Partnership is required to get the audit done only in the case that:-<br />
                                    1. The contributions of the LLP exceeds Rs. 25 Lakhs, or<br />

                                    For income tax purpose, LLP is treated on a par with partnership firms. Thus, LLP is liable for payment of income tax and share of its partners in LLP is not liable to tax. Thus no dividend distribution tax is payable. Provision of ‘deemed dividend’ under income tax law, is not applicable to LLP. Section 40(b): Interest to partners, any payment of salary, bonus, commission or remuneration allowed as deduction.

                                    A LLP as legal entity is capable of owning its funds and other properties. The LLP is the real person in which all the property is vested and by which it is controlled, managed and disposed off. The property of LLP is not the property of its partners. Therefore partners cannot make any claim on the property in case of any dispute among themselves.

                                    Another main benefit of incorporation is the taxation of a LLP. LLP are taxed at a lower rate as compared to Company. Moreover, LLP are also not subject to Dividend Distribution Tax as compared to company, so there will not be any tax while you distribute profit to your partners.

                                    Financing a small business like sole proprietorship or partnership can be difficult at times. A LLP being a regulated entity like company can attract finance from PE Investors, financial institutions etc.

                                    In LLP, Partners unlike partnership are not agents of the partners and therefore they are not liable for the individual act of other partners in LLP, which protects the interest of individual partners.

                                    As the year draws to a close, everyone is asking the same question – Should I form a Partnership or a Limited Liability Partnership? Which option will suit me better?
                                </p>
                                <p class="pb20">
                                    Technically, a Limited Liability Partnership has many advantages. In fact, it would not be wrong to say that an LLP combines some of the advantages of a Private Limited Company with some of the advantages of a simple Partnership.
                                </p>
                                <p class="pb20">
                                    On the flip side, a simple Partnership is much cheaper to form, unless you decide to register it. On the special request of a client, when we decided to register a Partnership deed in post- Anna Hazare India, we found that touts and agents were charging us between Rs. 7000 and Rs. 15,000 just to register the simple Partnership. It would actually have been much cheaper to form a LLP, where the registration is completely online.
                                </p>
                                <p class="pb20">
                                    So coming back to the main question we need to answer here, let us compare some of the features of a Partnership vis-à-vis an LLP.
                                </p>
                                <p class="pb20">
                                    From the comparison above, it seems very clear that a Partnership has certain limitations. We also recommend that in most cases, if you want to choose between the two, it makes a lot of sense to choose the limited liability partnership route. Even from the point of view of drafting contracts and interacting with third parties like investors, having an LLP is safer (although investors love Private Limited Companies).
                                </p>
                                <p class="pb20">
                                    If you want to form a Partnership for any reason, please note that it need not be registered. You can do business perfectly legally without registering the Partnership. The only disadvantage is that if there is a Court case, you need to fight in the name of the individual partners (which is not a major disadvantage since most people never fight a court case). So if you want to form a Partnership, go ahead and form one but steer clear of the burden of having it registered.
                                </p>
                                <p class="pb20">
                                    Finally, one major concern of many people is regulations and accounts. People choose to form a simple partnership because they do not want the legal regulations and secretarial norms that come along with forming a LLP or a Pvt. Ltd. Company. Worry not, the complexity is slightly overrated. While a Partnership is definitely easier from a regulatory point of view, all the basic procedures – getting a GST / IT registration, getting a PAN & TAN Card, opening a fresh bank account and getting an IEC still have to be complied with, even if you start as a simple Partnership. And if your income is above the taxable limit, you need to file tax returns irrespective of whether you are a simple Partnership, LLP or a Private Limited Company.
