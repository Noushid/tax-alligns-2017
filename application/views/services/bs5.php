                                    A Private Limited (Pvt. Ltd.) company is a company formed with 2 or more members. The maximum members prescribed are 200. Pvt. Ltd. companies are not listed on the stock exchanges, i.e. their shares cannot be freely traded. Since, it is relatively easier to register a Pvt. Ltd. company it is the preferable form of company for most businesses. The scope of a Private Ltd. company is limited, due to the restricted number of shareholders, but it enjoys less legal restrictions.

                                    A private limited company (pvt ltd company) is the most common vehicle to carry on business for an entity intending to make a profit and enjoy the benefits of an incorporated entity, particularly limited liability. Besides, limited liability and minimal statutory compliances, pvt ltd companies offer the following advantages:

                                    An entity means something which has a real existence; a thing with distinct existence. A company is a legal entity and a juristic person established under the Act. A juristic person is a person who is not a natural person or human being. Therefore a company form of organization has wide legal capacity and can own property and also incur debts. The members (Shareholders/Directors) of a company have no liability to the creditors of a company for such debts. Hence, a pvt ltd company is a legal entity separate from that of its members.

                                <p class="pb20">A company has ‘perpetual succession’, that is continued or uninterrupted existence until it is legally dissolved. A company, being a separate legal person, is unaffected by the death or other departure of any member but continues to be in existence irrespective of the changes in membership. Perpetual succession is one of the most important characteristics of a company.</p>

                                </div>
                                <p class="pb20">Limited Liability means the status of being legally responsible only to a limited amount for debts of a company. Unlike proprietorships and partnerships, in a limited liability company the liability of the members in respect of the company’s debts is limited. In other words, the liability of the members of a company is limited only to the extent of the face value of shares taken up by them. Therefore, where a company is limited by shares, the liability of the members on a winding-up is limited to the amount unpaid on their shares.</p>

                                <p class="pb20">Shares of a company limited by shares are transferable by a shareholder t any other person. The transfer is easy as compared to the transfer of interest in business run as a proprietary concern or a partnership. Filing and signing a share transfer form and handing over the buyer of the shares along with share certificate can easily transfer shares.</p>

                                <p class="pb20">A company being a juristic person, can acquire, own, enjoy and alienate, property in its own name. No shareholder can make any claim upon the property of the company so long as the company is a going concern. The shareholders are not the owners of the company’s property. The company itself is the true owner.</p>

                                <p class="pb20">To sue means to institute legal proceedings against or to bring a suit in a court of law. Just as one person can bring a legal action in his/her own name against another in that person’s name, a company being an independent legal entity can sue and also be sued in its own name.</p>

                                <p class="pb20">In the company form of organization it is possible for a company to make a valid and effective contract with any of its members. It is also possible for a person to be in control of a company and at the same time be in its employment. Thus, a person can at the same time be a shareholder, creditor, director and also an employee of the company.</p>

                                <p class="pb20">A company enjoys better avenues for borrowing of funds. It can issue debentures, secured as well as unsecured and can also accept deposits from the public, etc. Even banking and financial institutions prefer to render large financial assistance to a company rather than partnership firms or proprietary concerns.</p>

                                <p class="pb20">Starting a business is one of the most interesting and rewarding experience of anyone’s life. When starting a new business, after the idea generation, the next one of the critical decisions required is the selection of business entity. The choice of the business entity has long term implications for throughout the business’ life-cycle.

A&T ALLIANCE has a professional team to support you in achieving the heights of your dream business. Our experts will suggest you which form of business you should choose.

                                </div>
                                <p class="pb20">Great businesses are a product of great teams. Success in business is no longer determined by the capabilities of one person. Success in business is now determined by having the ability to quickly build great teams.</p>
                                <p class="pb20">Today, high performing employees are looking for more things than just a high salary. Therefore, to attract and retain good talent, businesses are offering a number of benefits like stock ownership, flex-time and training. Of the benefits provided, stock ownership is one of the most valued among prospective hires or existing employees. Employees who have stock ownership or ESOPs feel they are a part of the business, and it helps improve morale, retention and profits.</p>
                                <p class="pb20">Therefore, it is important for any business today to have the option of providing stock ownership or ESOPs to employees. Only private limited companies and limited companies can offer stock ownership and ESOP plans.</p>

                                    <h4 class="head4">Attract Funding</h4>

                                <p class="pb20">Funding is essential for starting, maintaining, and growing a business. A business can be self-funded, funded by friends and family, or by debt or equity. Growing a business today requires all four types of funding. Proprietorships, partnership firms, and Limited Liability Partnerships cannot issue shares, and are thereby unable to attract equity funding. This disadvantage could be critical in the growth stages of a business, wherein the business requires equity capital from sources like friends, family, angel investors or private equity firms to grow quickly.</p>
                                <p class="pb20">Today small businesses are being out-competed by larger businesses. Hence, it is essential for all businesses to grow quickly, and have the ability to attract funding from any source.  Thus, a private limited company is the ideal type of business entity for growing businesses.</p>

                                    <h4 class="head4">Limit the Risk to Personal Assets</h4>

                                <p class="pb20">Profit and loss are a part of a business. Therefore, it is important to be protected against losses, to protect our near and dear ones in case of financial difficulties. If a business owner has “limited liability” protection, it means that only the assets of the business are at risk, and not the promoter’s personal assets such as personal bank accounts, cars and houses.</p>
                                <p class="pb20">Therefore, it is important to register an entity that provides limited liability protection to its shareholders, such as a private limited company, a one person company, a limited company, or a limited liability partnership.</p>

                                <p class="pb20">Today customers, vendors and investors look for credibility in the businesses they deal with. If a business is started as a proprietorship or partnership firm, the business is not registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and cannot be located in the online company or LLP databases. Oftentimes, there is no credible proof of the business’ existence, making it hard to open a bank account, acquire reputed customers, or obtain credit from vendors.</p>
                                <p class="pb20">In starting a private limited company, the information relating to the company, such as name of the company, date of incorporation, registered office address, status of the company, and other information are made available in a publicly searchable database. This feature makes it easy to authenticate the existence of the business, improving business credibility.</p>

                                </div>
                                <p class="pb20">Successful entrepreneurs are often serial entrepreneurs, who go on to repeat the success they have in one business in multiple other ventures. They are also good at spotting opportunities early on and quickly move to exploit it. Virgin Group’s Richard Branson has reminisced about how he and his friends, when running a student magazine at the age of 16, noticed that the readers were interested in music, and started a mail-order record business. They ran ads in their magazine to promote it. The two businesses complemented each other well and developed synergies. Today the Virgin Group operates hundreds of companies over a range of industries.</p>
                                <p class="pb20">Businesses started as a proprietorship or partnership would have trouble pursuing many opportunities that come their way, as they are not considered separate legal entities and are tied to the promoter. Starting a private limited company, on the other hand, would allow the promoter to pursue multiple opportunities as the business evolves over time.</p>

                                <p class="pb20">Most entrepreneurs, while launching their businesses, only think about expanding their businesses, and never have an exit plan. An exit plan is essential for every business to capitalize, and for entrepreneurs to get rewarded for all their hard work. Further, the entity choice made at the start of the business, without any consideration for an exit plan, could have huge implications down the road.</p>
                                <p class="pb20">Private limited companies offer the best type of exit strategy for all promoters. Only shares of a company can be sold or transferred in part or whole to another entity easily without any hassles, while the business remains a going concern. Therefore, starting a private limited company provides a tremendous edge in planning and executing a business exit plan.</p>

                                <p class="pb20">The internet has made the world a smaller place. Gone are the days when Indian companies would develop products for foreign businesses. Today, Indian startups are developing products that compete on a global scale, and Indian businesses are started with aspirations to becoming multinational corporations. Investments from and collaborations with foreign businesses play an important role in the journey to becoming a multinational corporation.</p>
                                <p class="pb20">Private limited companies and limited companies are the only types of entities that allow for Foreign Direct Investment of up to 100% through the automatic route, meaning, any foreign entity or foreign person can invest in a company without any prior government approval. Entities like proprietorship, partnership and limited liability partnership require prior approval from the Government to accept investments from foreign entities. Therefore, if your business has aspirations for going international, then it is best to start a private limited company.</p>
