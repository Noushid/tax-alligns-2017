                                    A sole proprietorship is the oldest and the most common form of business. It is a one-man organization where a single individual owns, manages and controls the business. Its main features are:-

                                            Ease of formation is its most important feature because it is not required to go through elaborate legal formalities. No agreement is to be made and registration of the firm is also not essential. However, the owner may be required to obtain a license specific to the line of business from the local administration

                                    Majority of the businesses in India are unregistered with many being operated as a sole proprietorship firm business.  A sole proprietorship is one of the easiest and simplest forms of business entity to register and maintain in India. There is no formal sole proprietorship registration and to start a proprietorship only PAN number for the Proprietor, certain licenses and capital is required. In this article, we look at the process for forming a sole proprietorship in India.

                                    As a sole proprietor, main objective of the firm is opening a current bank account on the name of business. So basically most of the banks ask for any legal certification where your legal business name with proprietorship status has been mentioned. So there is lot of the valid certifications works in case of sole proprietorship firm. So here we divided all the certification in mainly 2 categories as per the RBI Compliance to open a current bank account.

                                    There is no formal procedure in India to register a sole proprietorship, as a sole proprietorship is considered to be an extension of the Proprietor. Therefore, the existence of a sole proprietorship business can be established only through opening a bank account in the name of the proprietorship firm or obtaining licenses required for conducting the business.  To open a bank account for a sole proprietorship, RBI’s KYC norms mandate that any two of the following document must be submitted to the Bank:
