                                The concept of TDS was introduced with an aim to collect tax from the very source of income. As per this concept, a person (deductor) who is liable to make payment of specified nature to any other person (deductee) shall deduct tax at source and remit the same into the account of the Central Government. The deductee from whose income tax has been deducted at source would be entitled to get credit of the amount so deducted on the basis of Form 26AS or TDS certificate issued by the deductor.

                                Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is a system introduced by Income Tax Department, where person responsible for making specified payments such as salary, commission, professional fees, interest, rent, etc. is liable to deduct a certain percentage of tax before making payment in full to the receiver of the payment. As the name suggests, the concept of TDS is to deduct tax at its source. Let us take an example of TDS assuming the nature of payment is professional fees on which specified rate is 10%.

                                XYZ Ltd makes a payment of Rs 50,000/- towards professional fees to Mr. ABC, then XYZ Ltd shall deduct a tax of Rs 5,000/- and make a net payment of Rs 45,000/- (50,000/- deducted by Rs 5,000/-) to Mr. ABC. The amount of 5,000/- deducted by XYZ Ltd will be directly deposited by XYZ Ltd to the credit of the government.

                                        <p class="pb20">Persons responsible for paying salary are liable to deduct tax on estimated salary at prescribed rate of 15% subject to following:</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">Exemption Limit: No tax is required to be deducted at source unless the estimated salary exceeds basic exemption limit.</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">Exempt allowances: Allowances such as LTC, HRA, conveyance, travelling exempt as per prescribed limits and other perquisites not forming part of salary should be deducted from total salary while calculating taxable salary.</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">Other deductions: Other deductions such as deductions under section 80C, 80CCC, 80CCD, 80CCG, 80D, 80DD, 80DDB, 80E, 80EE, etc. should be considered before the calculation of tax on salary.</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">If after comprehensive calculation of allowable allowances, taxable perquisites and deductions under chapter VI-A, income from salary head exceeds a sum of basic exemption limit, then tax has to be deducted by the employer @ 15% on the amount over and above the basic exemption limit. For example, the salary of Mr. A arrives at Rs 2,80,000/- assuming that all the allowances, perquisites, and deductions have been taken into consideration, tax @ 15% on Rs 30000/- (2,80,000 – 2,50,000) shall be deducted by the employer.</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">Hence, provisions of TDS shall attract only if minimum salary is above the basic exemption limit.</p>

                                    <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
                                        <div class="title-post">
                                            <h4 class="head4">TDS REFUND</h4>
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="pb20">There is this major misconception that refund of excess TDS is different from income tax refund and is called as TDS refund. However, the fact is that there is only one kind of return which you claim while filing your annual income tax return. Nowadays, it is compulsory to quote bank account details such as account number and IFSC code while filing of return and non-entering of such details will not generate a valid .xml file. In case if someone has deducted more tax than he should have deducted, then income tax refund will arise which can be claimed upon the filing of your annual income tax return.</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">For example, you own a goods transport agency and yours is a proprietorship firm. You presented an invoice of Rs 50,000/- and the person paying freight paid you a net amount of Rs 49,000/- (after deducting tax of Rs 1,000/- @ 2% under section 194C). In this case, the deductor deducted tax @ 2% instead of 1% and hence deducted excess TDS by Rs 500/-. This excess TDS will arise as a refund in the income tax return.</p>

                                        <p class="pb20">Payment of TDS each month and filing of quarterly return of TDS are 2 separate processes and due dates for these processes are different</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">The due dates for the payment of the deducted TDS are on or before 7th of next month. It mena, if the deductor has deducted tax from payments in month of November, then he has to pay the TDS  on or before 7th of December. Key point to note here is that the due dates are same for all type of assesses whether its Salaried case or non-salaried case.</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">These due dates are applicable to all non-Government assesses and also to Government assessees who deposit tax with Challan as specified by income tax department.  If the challans are not used to make payment of TDS by government assesses, then the due date for payment of TDS will be the same day on which the amount is deducted.<br /><br /><b>Monthly due dates for payment TDS.</b></p>

For example, ABC Limited paid a commission of Rs 2,00,000/- during the year to a single person and omitted to deduct tax on the same, then the Assessing Officer has powers to disallow deduction whole of such expenses while ascertaining taxable profits.</p>

                                        <p class="pb20">Tax is to be deducted at the time of payment/credit getting due or payment whichever is earlier. In the terms of income tax, even a single day is counted as a month for the purpose of calculating interest. In cases of late deduction of tax, interest @ 1% per month of the TDS amount subject to maximum amount of TDS is levied. For example, ABC company was supposed to deduct tax of Rs 20000/- on 15th July but instead the same was deducted by the company on 1st August. In this case interest of Rs 200/- (@1% for one month) is required to be paid by the assessee.</p>

                                        <p class="pb20">Tax is to be deducted and paid to the credit of government on every 7th day of the succeeding month in which the tax has been deducted, otherwise, interest @ 1.5% per month of TDS amount subject to maximum amount of TDS is levied. For example, ABC Ltd was supposed to deposit TDS of Rs 20000/- deducted in the month of April by 7th of May but fails to deposit the same on time and actually deposited the same in the following month. In this case interest of Rs. 300/- (@ 1.5% for one month) is required to paid by the assessee.</p>

                                        <p class="pb20">TDS returns are required to be filed in the last month of following quarter i.e. 31st July, 31st October, 31st January and in the case of March it is 31st May. Fees under section 234E are levied @ Rs 200/- per day subject to maximum amount of TDS until the return is filed. Example, M/s ABC, a partnership deducted and paid a total TDS of Rs 40000/- in the first quarter of FY and was supposed to file its TDS return by 31st July but filed its return on 31st August. Total fees of Rs 6200 (200/- per day for 31 says) shall be paid before filing of return.</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">Assessing officer may direct a person who fails to file the statement of TDS within due date to pay penalty minimum of Rs. 10,000 which may extend to Rs.1,00,000.

                                        <p class="pb20">Under the section, 194A tax is to be deducted on payment of interest other than interest on securities. However, no tax is required to be deducted if amount of such interest paid or credited or is likely to be paid or credited does not exceed Rs 10,000/- in case of banking company, co-operative society engaged in the business of banking and post office deposits and Rs 5,000/- in any other case in a financial year. Also, note that no tax is to be deducted on savings account interest.</p>

                                        <p class="pb20"><b>Scenario 2: </b> Say interest paid or credited or is likely to be paid or credited by a banking company to a person in a financial year is Rs 12,000/-, then tax is required to be deducted on the whole amount of Rs 12,000/- @ 10% i.e. TDS of Rs 1200/-. Please note that Rs 10,000/- is a cap just for fixing responsibility of banking company for TDS and is not an exemption limit i.e. tax is to be deducted from the whole amount of Rs 12,000/- as soon as the amount exceeds the cap amount of 10,000/-</p>

The definition of a contract is derived from the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and covers almost all type of contracts under its purview. However, no tax is to be deducted where:</p>

                                        <p class="pb20">In this case, the firm need not deduct tax on installments since the amount hasn’t exceeded the cap of Rs 30,000/-.

Hence, in this case, the tax is to be deducted from the whole amount of Rs 75,000/- @ 1% (being an individual), which arrives at Rs 750/-. Please note that once the total amount exceeds Rs 75000/- in a financial year, the tax is to be deducted from each and every payment irrespective of the fact whether such part payments are more or less than Rs 30,000/-.</p>

                                        <p class="pb20">There are mainly two sections that prescribe for deduction of taxes on transaction related to an immovable property:</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">Section 194-I: Section 194-I requires for deduction of tax at source on rental income @ 10% for rent on land & building if the total amount of rent paid/credited or to be paid/to be credited exceeds the cap of Rs 1,80,000/- during a financial year. Please note that individuals and HUFs who are not subject to tax audits under section 44AB need not deduct tax at source on such rental expenses.</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">Section 194IA: Section 194IA came into effect from June 2013 which required deduction of tax by the transferee before making payment to transferor @ 1% of the consideration for immovable property. Any sum paid by way of consideration for the transfer of any immovable property (other than agricultural land) is covered under section 194-IA, provided the consideration for the transfer of an immovable property is not less than Rs. 50 lakhs.</p>
                                        <p class="pb20">Section 194LA: Section 194LA provides for deduction of tax at source @ 10% for the payment to be made to the assessee as a compensation on account of compulsory acquisition of immovable property. Please note that no deduction shall be made under this section where the amount of such payment or, as the case may be, the aggregate amount of such payments to a resident during the financial year does not exceed Rs 250000/-.</p>

                                        <p class="pb20">Here is what the Finance Minister proposed in his speech: “It is proposed to introduce a new provision in the Income-tax Act to provide for tax deduction at source at the rate of five per cent. by an individual or HUF, other than those whose books of account are required to be audited, while making payment of rent of an amount exceeding Rs. 50,000 per month. It is also proposed to provide that such tax shall be deducted and deposited only once in a financial year through a challan cum-statement. Further, the deductor shall not be required to obtain TAN or file any separate TDS return for this purpose.” Can you explain the change? Under the current laws, Individuals and HUF (other than those liable for tax audit) were out of the scope of section 194-I of the Act which required deduction of tax at source when rents were paid in excess of Rs.1,80,000.00. The government today introduced a new section 194-IB which comes to effect from the 1st June, 2017 has brought these individuals and HUF payments under the rule. So while anyone other than Individuals and HUF deducted TDS while making rent payments (any payment, by whatever name called, under any lease, sublease, tenancy or any other agreement or arrangement for the use of any land or building or both), Individuals and HUF were exempted from doing so under the law. Now both the parties (Individuals and HUF) will be responsible to deduct a tax at source of 5% of the rent collected if the monthly payment to another resident exceeds Rs. 50,000/-. The amount so deducted shall be deposited only once a year through a challan cum statement without the payee being obliged to obtain a TAN or file any separate TDS return for this purpose</p>
