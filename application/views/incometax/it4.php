                                As per sections 44AA of the Income-tax Act, 1961, a person engaged in business is required to maintain regular books of account under certain circumstances. To give relief to small taxpayers from this tedious work, the Income-tax Act has framed the presumptive taxation scheme under sections 44AD, sections 44ADA and sections 44AE. A person adopting the presumptive taxation scheme can declare income at a prescribed rate and, in turn, is relieved from tedious job of maintenance of books of account.

                                        ​​If a person opts for presumptive taxation scheme then he is also require to follow the same scheme for next 5 years. If he failed to do so, then presumptive taxation scheme will not be available for him for next 5 years. [For example, an assessee claims to be taxed on presumptive basis under Section 44AD for AY 2017-18. For AY 2018-19 and 2019-20 also he offers income on basis of presumptive taxation scheme. However, for AY 2020-21, he did not opt for presumptive taxation Scheme. In this case, he will not be eligible to claim benefit of presumptive taxation scheme for five AYs, i.e. from AY 2021-22 to 2025-26.]

                                        The important criterion of the scheme is the restriction of owning of not more than 10 goods vehicles at any time during the year. Thus, if a person owns more than 10 goods vehicles at any time during the year, then he cannot take advantage of this scheme.

                                        In case of a person who is willing to opt for the presumptive taxation scheme of sections 44AE, income will be computed on an estimated basis. Income will be computed @ Rs. 7,500 per month or part thereof during which the goods vehicle is owned by the taxpayer, in the previous year. Part of the month would be considered as full month.<br />Note: If the actual income is higher, than the presumptive rate, i.e., higher than Rs. 7,500, then such higher income can be declared.
