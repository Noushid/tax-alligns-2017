Assessment year is the year in which you will file your return for the previous year. For example – if you start your job on 1st January 2017, your tax year closes on 31st March 2017. 2016-17 is your previous year and your assessment year is 2017-18. You will be filing your return in assessment year 2017-18, for which the last date will be 31st July 2017.
