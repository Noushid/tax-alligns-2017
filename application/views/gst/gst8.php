                                GST implementation is set to go-live in 2017, completely overhauling India's indirect tax system. Under the new GST regime, GST registration would be required for all enterprises involved in the buying or selling or delivery of services exceeding Rs.10 lakhs a year in north-eastern and hill states, while the limit is Rs.20 lakhs for rest of India. All entities having GST registration would be required to file GST returns. GST return filing would be mandatory for all GST registered entities irrespective of if there was any activity / sale during the return filing period.

                                        For properly updating the invoices, Indian taxpayers and businesses have to file certain returns with the Government. These returns have to be mandatorily filed as any non-compliance towards the same may lead to disallowance of input tax credit, apart from attracting penalties and interests, etc. Proper filing of information and passing the same in the returns is a mandatory process for smooth flow of credit to the last recipient.
