                                The GST provision, requiring any goods more than Rs 50,000 in value to be pre-registered online before it can be moved, is likely to kick in from October after a centralized software platform is ready, a top official said. The provision, called the e-way bill, would be implemented after infrastructure for smooth generation of registration and its verification through hand-held devices with tax officials is ready. The information technology platform for the e-way bill system is being developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) along with GST-Network -- the company which has developed the IT backbone for the new indirect tax regime.

                                    On the 22nd GST council of 06/10/2017, it is decided that the e-way bill will likely to be made fully applicable from April 1, 2018, as also rules on tax deducted at sources (TDS) and tax collected at source (TCS). Under GST rules, ferrying goods worth more than Rs 50,000 within or outside a state will require securing an e-way bill by prior online registration of the consignment. To generate an e-way bill, the supplier and transporter will have to upload details on the GSTN portal, after which a unique e-way bill number (EBN) will be made available to the supplier, the recipient and the transporter on the common portal.
