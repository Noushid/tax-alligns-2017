                                GST defines a transaction as ‘Supply’ when there is a transfer, exchange, rental, lease, barter, disposal or license of goods or services. Whenever a transaction takes place, a tax invoice has to be issued depending on the occurrence of any such event or within a prescribed time limit. Hence, every taxpayer registered under the GST network shall be required to issue a tax invoice for the supply of goods or services.
                            </p>
                            <p class="pt20 pb30">
                                Tax invoices have to be raised under certain circumstances. In the case of supply of goods, the invoices shall be raised within the prescribed time as enumerated below.

                                        The Government of India has come out with a sample GST Invoice format. A sample format is shown below. It is better to issue invoices on the same lines as the example since your Input Tax Credit largely depends on the Invoice Number and its proper reporting. The serial number of the invoice forms the basis of mismatch or matching the invoices between the supplier and the receiver, giving a seamless, hassle-free credit flow.
