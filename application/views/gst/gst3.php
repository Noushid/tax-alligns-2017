                               By considering Small and Medium enterprises, Goods and Services Tax has introduced Composition Scheme under GST, which is merely an extension o the current scheme under VAT law. When opting for the Composition Scheme under GST, a taxpayer will be required to file summarized returns on a quarterly basis, instead of three monthly returns (as applicable for normal businesses). In this article, we have addressed some of the basic queries around Composition Scheme under Goods and Services Tax Law.

                                Goods and Services Tax is set to bring along a new regime of business compliance in India. Large organizations have the requisite resources and expertise to address these requirements. On the flip side, many startups and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) may struggle to comply with these provisions. To resolve such scenarios, the government has introduced Composition Scheme under GST, which is merely an extension o the current scheme under VAT law. When opting for the Composition Scheme under GST, a taxpayer will be required to file summarized returns on a quarterly basis, instead of three monthly returns (as applicable for normal businesses).
