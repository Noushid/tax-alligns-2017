                                        The Federal Tax Authority of UAE has been announced that VAT to be implemented in 01, January, 2017.  GAZT of KSA also declared the VAT rules and regulations expecting to be implemented in January 2018. By implementing VAT, the UAE, KSA and other GCC governments will get a new source of income which will enable them to provide high quality public services, like health care, transportation and roads, rescue and police services, entertainment parks, games and stadium and many more in the future. The UAE and KSA businesses have to record their financial transactions to ensure that all financial records are accurate and updated. The mandatory registration required businesses have to prepare books of accounts, maintain accounting records and present it before tax authorities as and when required.

                                        We have witnessed that many nations have introduced taxation or revise the existing taxation due to shortage of fund or to meet additional expenditure in their country. Whatever the reason may be, the citizen, the residents and businesses of those nations have to struggle with the new tax legislation.

                                        The businesses have to acquire additional resources to meet the new changes. In addition, businesses have to overcome the transition period from existing system to the newly introduced taxation system. Recently the India replaced the existing VAT system by GST was the biggest change that the corporate world discussed. After that another waves of taxation was arose from GCC. Finally UAE and KSA have declared the VAT implementation and the Federal Tax Authority declared 1st January 2018 as the VAT beginning date.

                                        It is a light beginning within threshold limits for mandatory and voluntary registrations under VAT. The introductions of VAT in GCC indicate that, the businesses have to keep a proper and systematic accounting and bookkeeping.
